# ü™∏ Coral Restoration Optimisation Tool

A linear optimisation support tool that illustrates how data-driven methods can guide complex resource allocation problems. Applied here to coral restoration projects to balance ecological function and diversity with operational constraints.

### üìñ Background
Coral restoration is often measured by the number of corals planted, but many projects can fail in the long term because they overlook ecological function and diversity. Different restoration goals require different coral communities, a reef rebuilt to protect shorelines requires a different species mix than one focused on increasing biodiversity, fish biomass or eco-tourism.
Often projects default to branching _Acroporidae_ because it grows quickly and shows visible results, especially in tourist regions. However monocultures lack resilience: just as single-crop agriculture collapses under pests or disease, single-family coral plantings are highly vulnerable to bleaching, storms, and disease. Evidence from marine and terrestrial systems shows that diverse, functionally complementary communities are far more resilient. 

This tool aims to explore providing restoration teams with a practical starting point for planning growth form and ideally species/family composition, aligning ecological science with operational planning. Building on insights such as Madin et al. (2023), which identified functionally optimal coral species, we grouped the species by growth form to give a starting proportion split. The model translates these principles into actionable allocations of reef stars. The aim is not only to scale restoration, but to ensure projects restore functionally resilient reef ecosystems rather than short-lived monocultures.


## üö∂ Walkthrough of the App

This section explains each part of the app, what it does, and whether user input is required.

### üîß Global Options

#### What it is: 
Advanced settings to control the optimisation.
#### User input: 
Optional: defaults are provided.
- Normalise proportions: Ensures proportions sum to 1 (recommended).
- Proportion tolerance: Allows minor deviations from exact targets to account for whole fragments.
- Survival rate: Assumed % of fragments surviving to reproductive maturity (default 60%, based on peer-reviewed syntheses).
- Use ecological function weightings: If enabled, the optimiser maximises a weighted ecological score (allocation √ó growth form score) instead of just total fragments.
--- 
### ü™∏ Available Fragments per Growth Form

#### What it is: 
- The starting supply of coral fragments available in each growth form (e.g. branching, massive).
#### User input: 
- Required: Tick the growth forms you plan to use and enter the number of fragments available. Unticked growth forms are excluded from the optimisation, but their columns remain visible for clarity.
---
### üìä Coral Growth Form Proportions

#### What it is: 
- Target proportions for each growth form. Defaults are derived from Madin et al. (2023) by filtering their recommended species for the Indian Ocean and grouping into growth forms.
#### User input:
- Optional, adjust if you have different restoration goals or local ecological knowledge.
---
### ‚öñÔ∏è Optimal Allocation (Linear Programming)

#### What it is: 
- The optimiser (using PuLP) calculates the best allocation of fragments across growth forms.

**Constraints:**
 - Each growth form must meet its minimum target proportion.
 - Allocations cannot exceed available supply.

**Objective:**
- If ecological weightings are off ‚Üí maximise the total number of fragments allocated.
- If ecological weightings are on ‚Üí maximise the weighted ecological score, subject to the constraints.
#### User input: 
- None - this is calculated automatically.
#### Outputs:
- A table of available fragments, optimal allocation, target %, achieved %, and (if enabled) ecological score contributions.
- A bar chart comparing available vs. allocated fragments.
- A pie chart showing proportional allocation.

### üåê Simulated Reef Layout

#### What it is: 
- A simple visualisation of how ‚Äúreef stars‚Äù (clusters of ~14 fragments) might be distributed across a restoration site.
- Includes clustering weights to encourage fusion growth.
#### User input:
- Clustering weights for each growth form (0‚Äì1).
- Shuffle button to randomise layout.
- Restoration site area and shape.
---
### üìè Ecological Benchmarks
#### What it is: 
- Benchmarks from Ricardo et al. (2025) suggest 13‚Äì50 colonies per 100 m¬≤ are required for ‚â•10% fertilisation success. The tool estimates whether your plan meets this, adjusted by the assumed survival rate.
#### User input: 
- None ‚Äî calculated automatically.
